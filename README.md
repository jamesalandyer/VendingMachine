# VendingMachine
A command line vending machine that allows you to feed money in and get items from the vending machine.

This is a command line Java application that allows you to buy items from a vending machine. It allows you to view the items that were populated from a csv file. You then can start a transaction which allows you to feed in money and to purchase items. It displays the item details along with how many are left. Once you are done, you can finish the transaction which it then gives you your change back.
